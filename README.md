# Conferences

2023 is going to be the year I speak at a conference for the first time. 

I couldnâ€™t find an app that helped me keep track of the conferences Iâ€™ve applied to, and my ideas for talksâ€¦ so Iâ€™ve started making one ðŸ˜Ž

## Contributing

Pull requests and feature requests are welcome.
I am developing this in the open and will release it, when it's good enough!

## Some Future Ideas
* Better macOS / watchOS Support
* ChatGPT for Talk Ideas
* Integration with PaperCall API to automatically submit talks (may need a sponsor)
* API / Web Hooks for conferences to provide their own info / schedules

## Implemented
* ~~List of conferences on a remote web server~~
* ~~Push notifications for new conferences~~
