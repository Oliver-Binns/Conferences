# Conferences

2023 is going to be the year I speak at a conference for the first time. 

I couldnâ€™t find an app that helped me keep track of the conferences Iâ€™ve applied to, and my ideas for talksâ€¦ so Iâ€™ve started making one ðŸ˜Ž

## Contributing

Pull requests and feature requests are welcome - this app is being developed fully in the open.

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) are required for each pull request to ensure that release versioning can be managed automatically.
Please ensure that you have enabled the Git hooks, so that you don't get caught out!:
```
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```

## Some Future Ideas
* Better macOS / watchOS Support
* ChatGPT for Talk Ideas
* Integration with PaperCall API to automatically submit talks (may need a sponsor)
* API / Web Hooks for conferences to provide their own info / schedules

## Implemented
* ~~List of conferences on a remote web server~~
* ~~Push notifications for new conferences~~
